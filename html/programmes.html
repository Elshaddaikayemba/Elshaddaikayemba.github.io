The Positions
</h1>
<p>There are three positions you can apply for at a Camp in Canada.
They are general camp counsellor, activities camp counsellor and support staff.
While the counsellor positions are the most popular and have you working closely
with the children,
all positions need you to be highly energetic and outgoing.
Theses positions are great opportunities to boost your skills,
add international work to your CV and to immerse yourself in the Canadian culture.
</p>

<h1 style="color: #af0808;">
<p>
The Application Process
</p>
</h1>
<p>
Applying to Camp Canada is quite simple and throughout the process we are there
to help you through. If you have any questions along the way one of our staff
members are always ready and willing to answer them.
</p>

<h1 style="color: #af0808;">
  <p>
Stage One: Application and Interview
</p>
</h1>
<p>
To apply to the programme you’ll need to make the first stage payment for £69,
this shows commitment to the programme and covers the cost of the interview.. Once
this payment is made, you’ll receive an application. After you have complete your
application and returned it back to the team, we’ll review your application and,
if you are a rock star on paper, invite you to do an interview with either a
member of staff or your local campus manager. These interviews are informal, but
informative meetings that allow us to get to know you and your skills better so
that we can ensure you have the strongest application possible and that we have
the correct information about you to match you up with the right camp.
</P>

<h1 style="color: #af0808;">
  <p>
Stage Two: Documentation
</p>
</h1>
<p>
Once the interview is done you will have 14 days to submit the rest of your
application, 3 references and a short application video. This is how the Camp
Directors in Canada will get to know what kind of person you are on a personal
level so make sure you talk about your skills in your video and include a few
photos of you doing them. The references cannot be from friends or family members
and must contain active contact details so we can verify them. Teachers, employers
or coaches are the best references to fill out the forms.
